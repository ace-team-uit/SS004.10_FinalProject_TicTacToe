# Select Game Page Implementation

## Overview

The Select Game Page is a key screen in the ACE Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows players to choose game modes and navigate to other sections.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Layout & Design

- **Space Theme Background**: Deep indigo to dark blue gradient
- **Fixed Size Design**: Optimized for 6:19 aspect ratio mobile design (configured in components.css)
- **Simple Layout**: Clean, focused design using provided design assets

### 2. UI Components

#### Header

- "SELECT GAME" title with custom font (RoleyPoley)
- Fade-in animation from top

#### Game Logo

- **Logo**: Uses `assets/images/logo.png` as specified
- Centered positioning with drop shadow effect
- Fade-in animation

#### Single Player Button

- **Button Image**: Uses `assets/images/select-game/single-player.png` as specified
- Hover and active states with scale effects
- Drop shadow for depth

#### Bottom Navigation

- Three navigation buttons using specified images:
  - **Marketplace**: `assets/images/common/marketplace-button.png`
  - **Home**: `assets/images/common/home-button.png`
  - **Settings**: `assets/images/common/setting-button.png`
- Hover effects with scale changes

### 3. Design Philosophy

- **Asset-Driven**: Uses exact images from design specifications
- **Minimal CSS**: Simple styling focused on layout and interactions
- **No Responsive**: Fixed size design as per game requirements
- **Consistent**: Follows same pattern as home page

## Technical Implementation

### Files

- `screens/select/select.html` - HTML structure
- `screens/select/select.css` - Styling and animations
- `screens/select/select.screen.js` - Event handlers and navigation

### Dependencies

- `styles/global.css` - Global styles and variables
- `styles/variables.css` - CSS custom properties
- `styles/components.css` - Phone viewport configuration
- `shared/logic/navigation.js` - Navigation system
- `assets/images/logo.png` - Game logo
- `assets/images/select-game/single-player.png` - Single player button
- `assets/images/common/*.png` - Navigation button images

### Navigation Routes

- **Single Player** → Game screen
- **Marketplace** → Marketplace screen
- **Home** → Home screen
- **Settings** → Settings screen

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Image Usage

- **Logo**: Direct usage of `logo.png` without additional styling
- **Single Player Button**: Direct usage of `single-player.png`
- **Navigation**: Direct usage of provided button images
- **No Custom Graphics**: All visual elements come from design assets

### 2. Layout Structure

- **Header**: Title at top
- **Logo**: Centered in main area
- **Button**: Below logo
- **Navigation**: Fixed at bottom
- **Background**: Simple gradient without complex effects

### 3. Animations

- **Simple**: Only basic fade-in animations
- **Performance**: Lightweight CSS transitions
- **Consistent**: Same timing as home page

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. Open `index.html` and navigate to Select screen
2. Verify all images display correctly
3. Test button interactions
4. Check navigation to other screens
5. Verify phone viewport sizing

### Expected Behavior

- All specified images should display at correct sizes
- Buttons should have hover effects
- Navigation should work to all specified routes
- Layout should fit within phone viewport constraints

## Future Considerations

### 1. Asset Updates

- If design assets change, only image paths need updating
- No CSS changes required for new button designs
- Maintains separation of design and implementation

### 2. Additional Features

- Could add sound effects for interactions
- Could add loading states for navigation
- Could add transition animations between screens

## Performance Notes

- Minimal CSS for fast rendering
- Direct image usage without processing
- Simple animations for smooth performance
- Fixed sizing eliminates layout calculations
